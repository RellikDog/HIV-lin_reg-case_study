We used the following regression models:
- Linear Regression (both stats models and sklearn)
- K-Fold Linear Regression
- Regularization with K-Fold 

The metric we used to quantify our model was root mean squared error, although this value would fluctuate depending on the train/test split. The outlier with an incidence of 717 seemed to add greatly to the test errors. Below are the values we got for the different methods. 

- stats.models Linear Regression: 9.35
- sklean Linear Regression: 9.35
- Regularization + KFold: 1.75

The regularizaion parameter alpha was chosen as the parameter for which the test errors were the smallest. The plot below shows the variation in train and test errors as alpha is changed and alpha = 3 corresponds to the minimum test errors.
